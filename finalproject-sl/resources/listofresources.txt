Nav bar idea stemmed from:
http://www.latteda.com/

Social media icons:
https://www.iconfinder.com/
Then I edited them in Photoshop.

Animated gallery:
http://www.menucool.com/
I pulled appropriate images from search engines, and edited the css/images to fit the gallery and theme of website.

Idea for menu set-up came to me while viewing:
http://www.timhortons.com/us/en/menu/snacks.php

E-mailing list:
http://www.bravenet.com/

Gallery page used images provided by instructor. Some images throughout the site were modified by me in Photoshop for stylistic choice.

I did not use any website templates, just general knowledge of modern websites, knowledge gained from this class, and inspiration gathered above.
